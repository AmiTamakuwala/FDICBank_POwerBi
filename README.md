# FDICBank_POwerBi
Power Bi Project Pro

here, I come up with my new Advance Pro Project in Power Bi Tool.
Power Bi, Tableau is not just a tool that only gives you Visualization. But we can do Visualizing, data Modeling, Dax, and Data Reports, sharing or Publishing the dashboard report on the Web, or My workspace, or maybe with your workspace team.

I used FDIC live web dataset from US Government Site.
About Dataset: The FDIC is often appointed as a receiver for failed banks. This list includes banks that have failed since October 1, 2000.

Dataset Link:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fdic-failed-bank-list

from there get data from here,

    https://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.csv

from the image in the marking area, there are some different uses and data modeling I am trying to work on. In the Q&A chart, we can ask any question related to our dataset like, here I asked about the total failed banks between 2015 to 2022 using state, and city so it shows up with map visualization, likewise asking the same ques but next time with a tree map. So, the Power BI tool automatically come up with appropriate visualization. Next, If you ask in the stack bar plot for whichever year and city or state it will come up in the tooltip with a map and total bank visualization,
Isn't it amazing?
The next most important feature is data modeling in Power Bi, So, here I created a new table where I worked with the model view, DAX, report views, etc.

this Project is an advanced or Pro version of Power Bi.
